*Viewed [package.json](file:///Users/apple/middleeast/package.json) *

### Planner Response

The development server is now running at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

The application is accessible and currently redirecting to `/en` as expected.

> [!NOTE]
> I noticed a warning in the server output: `The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead.` This is coming from Next.js 16.1.6 but does not prevent the server from running.

Let me know if you need any help with testing or further development!

### User Input

oh perfect

### Planner Response

I'm glad everything is working well!

We've covered a lot of ground:
*   **Enhanced Brand Pages** with "Best Sellers" and "Discounted" sections.
*   **Merged** "Top Brands" and "Discover Brands" into a unified, interactive section.
*   **Interactive Collections** circles that link to their categories.
*   **Global Hover Effects** (scale/brighten/dim) applied to all lists.
*   **New Pages** for "Skincare Tips", "Makeup Tips", "Gift Sets", and "Next Arrivals".

What would you like to tackle next?
1.  Start adding **content** to those new pages (Skincare Tips, etc.)?
2.  Replace the temporary **"Nanobanana" images** with real assets?
3.  Adjust any other design elements or functionality?

### User Input

now I want you to use nano banana to create image for Skincare tips : make a high quality picture of a serum tube+cleansers (4 products in total) with a nude tone background, the products should be of 1 brand so use a pastel green label on products to make a fee;ing of fresh and new lifestyle

## Error Message
A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

### Planner Response

The [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) component currently filters by:
- `category` (which seems to check `product.category`)
- `department` (which checks `product.department`)
- `brand`
- etc.

In my new schema:
- `department` will correspond to the main Category (e.g. Skincare).
- `category` will correspond to the Subcategory (e.g. Toner).
- I should rename `category` to `subcategory` in [Product](cci:2://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-12:1) interface to be clearer, BUT [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) uses `category`.
- If I change [Product](cci:2://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-12:1) interface, I need to update [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) too.
- Let's keep `department` as "Main Category" and `category` as "Subcategory" for now to minimize refactoring, OR explicitly add `subcategory` and update [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) to filter by `subcategory` as well.
- The latter is safer and clearer.
- So:
    - Update [Product](cci:2://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-12:1) interface in [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0): add `subcategory?: string;`.
    - Update [ProductGridProps](cci:2://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:4:0-11:1) in [components/product/ProductGrid.tsx](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:0:0-0:0): add `subcategory?: string;`.
    - Update [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) filtering logic.
    - Update mock data in [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0) to include `subcategory` values matching the new map.

Plan:
1.  **Update [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0)**:
    *   Add `subcategory` to interface.
    *   Update existing products to have correct `department` (Main Category) and `subcategory` (Specific Type).
    *   Add new products to cover more categories.
2.  **Update [components/product/ProductGrid.tsx](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:0:0-0:0)**:
    *   Add `subcategory` prop.
    *   Add filtering logic for `subcategory`.
3.  **Create `app/[locale]/products/page.tsx`**:
    *   Read `searchParams`.
    *   Pass `category` (from URL param `category` -> maps to `department` in data) and `subcategory` (from URL param `subcategory` -> maps to `subcategory` in data) to [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1).
    *   Wait, the URL params are `category` and `subcategory`.
    *   My data has `department` and `category` (currently).
    *   Let's standardize.
    *   URL `category` -> Data `department`.
    *   URL `subcategory` -> Data `subcategory`.
    *   I will update [Product](cci:2://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-12:1) interface to have `department` (Main) and `subcategory` (Sub).
    *   I will *rename* the existing `category` field in [Product](cci:2://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-12:1) to `subcategory` to avoid confusion, OR keep `category` as a specific type and `department` as broad type.
    *   Actually, [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) uses `category`.
    *   Let's look at [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) again.
    *   It filters `category` against `product.category`.
    *   It filters `department` against `product.department`.
    *   So if I map URL `category` -> `department` and URL `subcategory` -> `category`, it might work with minimal changes.
    *   Let's check [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0) values again.
    *   Item 1: `category: "Illumination"`, `department: "skincare"`.
    *   Item 2: `category: "Hydration"`, `department: "skincare"`.
    *   Item 5: `category: "Color"`, `department: "makeup"`.
    *   So `department` is indeed the main category (but lowercase).
    *   And `category` is a sub-type.
    *   I should align `department` values with the new main categories (Skincare, Makeup) - they are capitalized in my new list.
    *   And I should update `category` values to match the new subcategories (Toner, Cream, etc.).
    *   So:
        *   Update [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0):
            *   Update `department` to match "Skincare", "Makeup", etc. (or keep lowercase and handle case insensitivity).
            *   Update `category` to match "Skin/toner", "Lip makeup", etc.
            *   Add new items.
        *   Create `app/[locale]/products/page.tsx`:
            *   Calls [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) with `department={searchParams.category}` and `category={searchParams.subcategory}`.
            *   (Mapping URL `category` to Prop `department`, and URL `subcategory` to Prop `category` is a bit confusing but correct based on current code).
            *   Title logic: `Subcategory` if present, else `Category`, else "All Products".

Let's do this.

First, update [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0). I'll add about 8 new products to have a decent spread.

And also, I need to create `app/[locale]/products/page.tsx`.

I'll start by creating `app/[locale]/products/page.tsx` first to establish the page, then update data.
Wait, if I create the page first, it might be empty or broken if data doesn't match.
Updating data first is safer.

Let's update [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0). I'll use `replace_file_content` to essentially rewrite the mock data list. Or `write_to_file` to overwrite it if I'm replacing most of it.
The file is small enough (175 lines) that I can overwrite it with `write_to_file`.

I need [getProducts](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:171:0-173:1) function and [Product](cci:2://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-12:1) interface.
I'll rewrite [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0) with updated data matching the new categories.

Then I'll create `app/[locale]/products/page.tsx`.

And I verified [components/product/ProductGrid.tsx](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:0:0-0:0) can handle `department` and `category`.
I might need to make the matching case-insensitive in [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) or ensure data and links match perfectly.
Reference:
Links in [CategoriesPage](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/app/%5Blocale%5D/categories/page.tsx:97:0-131:1):
`category.name` (e.g. "Skincare") -> URL `category`
`sub` (e.g. "Skin/toner") -> URL `subcategory`

Data in [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0):
`department`: should be "Skincare"
`category`: should be "Skin/toner"

So exact match should work if data is correct.

Refined Plan:
1.  Overwrite [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0) with new data reflecting the category structure.
2.  Create `app/[locale]/products/page.tsx`.
3.  Verify by visiting `/products?category=Skincare`.

One detail: [ProductGrid](cci:1://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/ProductGrid.tsx:13:0-44:1) logic:
```typescript
        if (category && product.category !== category) return false;
        if (department && product.department !== department) return false;
```
It uses strict inequality `!==`. So case must match.
I'll make sure mock data uses "Skincare", "Makeup", "Skin/toner" etc. exactly as in [categories/page.tsx](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/app/%5Blocale%5D/categories/page.tsx:0:0-0:0).

Let's write [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0). I will add items for Skincare, Makeup, Men's care, etc. I'll delete the "Perfume/Diffuser" and "Food" items if any (none currently).
I'll keep existing items but update their categories.

Item 1: Sulwhasoo Serum -> Skincare / Essence/Serum/Ampoule
Item 2: Laneige Cream -> Skincare / cream
Item 3: COSRX Elixir -> Skincare / Essence/Serum/Ampoule (or Treatment/Pack?) -> Essence...
Item 4: Innisfree Sunscreen -> Sun care / sunscreen
Item 5: Banila Co Lipstick -> Makeup / Lip makeup
Item 6: Laneige Foundation -> Makeup / Base makeup

I'll add:
- Cleansing foam (Cleansing)
- Shampoo (Hair care)
- Body lotion (Body care)
- Vitamin (Health food)

I'll execute.

save it plz

### Planner Response

Actually, I have already saved all the changes to your project files, including the updated [Discover.tsx](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/home/Discover.tsx:0:0-0:0), [lib/data.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/lib/data.ts:0:0-0:0), and the new [BrandSidebar.tsx](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/components/product/BrandSidebar.tsx:0:0-0:0) component. I also generated a high-quality thumbnail for the "Gift sets" collection and saved it directly to your [public/images/gift-sets.jpg](cci:7://file:///Users/apple/middleeast/public/images/gift-sets.jpg:0:0-0:0) path.

Everything is finalized and ready for you to review! You can check the brand pages to see the new sidebar and filtering in action, or the homepage to see the updated "Gift sets" thumbnail.

Is there anything else you'd like me to save or adjust?
